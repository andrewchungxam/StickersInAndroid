# Stickers In Android
A Xamarin.Android sample with two images -- one larger background image and another smaller draggable image on top.

![sticker_sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3628580/34062588-31412136-e1a2-11e7-8241-c2abf0f5db73.png)

In this sample, you can choose an image from your camera's photos which will become the first background image.

On top of that image, there is a smaller image (a vintage Xamarin logo).  You can drag this logo with one finger or you can resize it with a pinching gesture with two fingers.

This sample is based on these two samples: <br />
• [Touch in Android](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/application_fundamentals/touch/android_touch_walkthrough/)
<br />
• [Image Selection in Android](https://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/android/data/files/selecting_a_gallery_image/)
